### Explanation

1. **SalaryTableInput Component**: This component now correctly initializes the `salaries` state based on the `headers` (degrees and ages of work) and `categories`. It dynamically generates input fields for each combination of category, degree, and age of work. The `handleChange` function updates the `salaries` state whenever a value in an input field changes.

2. **SalaryTableForm Component**:
   - **Initialization and State Management**: `degrees`, `categories`, and `headers` are managed as state variables. `degrees` and `workingAges` are updated when adding a new degree and age of work.
   - **Handling Inputs and Selections**: The form allows selection of agreement, input of table number, selection of salary type, input of concerned employee, and selection of beginning and end dates of application.
   - **Handling Degree and Age of Work Addition**: `handleAddDegreeAndAgeOfWork` adds a new degree and age of work to the respective state variables.
   - **Handling Category Addition**: `handleAddCategory` adds a new category to the `categories` state.
   - **Saving**: `handleSave` constructs the complete salary table object and dispatches it for creation.

### Usage

- The `SalaryTableForm` component is used to create or update a salary table entry. It initializes necessary state variables and manages form inputs and selections.
- The `SalaryTableInput` component generates a table based on the provided headers (degrees and ages of work) and categories, allowing users to input salaries corresponding to each category, degree, and age of work combination.

## Implementing SalaryTableSheet

To implement the SalaryTableSheet component and integrate it with the rest of your application, you will need to create a matrix-like structure where salaries can be input based on degrees as headers and categories as rows. Additionally, a save button will be required to update the whole SalaryTable, including the matrix values.

Here's how you can go about it:

1. Create the SalaryTableSheet component:
2. Integrate SalaryTableSheet with the existing SalaryTableForm:
3. Handle the saving of the updated SalaryTable:
