# Using Redux vs useContext API

Using both Redux and the useContext API together can be a good solution in some scenarios, but it's important to understand when and why you might want to use each of them, as they serve different purposes:

## When to Use Redux

* **Global State Management**: Redux is great for managing global state that needs to be accessed and updated by many components across your application.
* **Complex State Logic**: If your state logic is complex, involving many actions and reducers, Redux provides a structured approach.
* **Debugging and DevTools**: Redux has excellent debugging tools, such as time-travel debugging, which can be very helpful for larger applications.
* **Consistency**: Redux ensures that the state is consistent across your application.

## When to Use useContext and useReducer

* **Local State Management**: useContext is useful for managing state that only a subset of your components need to access. It's simpler and more lightweight than Redux.
* **Simple State Logic**: For simpler state management needs, useContext and useReducer provide a straightforward way to share state and state update logic.
* **Performance**: For small to medium-sized applications, useContext can be more performant due to its simplicity and the reduced boilerplate code compared to Redux.

## Combining Redux and useContext

* **Separation of Concerns**: Sometimes, it makes sense to use useContext for very local or domain-specific state while using Redux for global state. This can keep your Redux store lean and focused on the most critical parts of your application state.
* **Performance Optimization**: Using useContext can avoid unnecessary re-renders that might happen with Redux when only a small part of the state is relevant to a component tree.
* **Scoped State**: You might have specific components or feature modules that have their own context and state management separate from the global Redux store. This can help in isolating parts of your application.
